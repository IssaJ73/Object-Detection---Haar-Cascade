# Haar Cascade Object Detector

A simple object detection project using Haar Cascades with OpenCV. This project demonstrates how to detect objects—such as faces, eyes, or other features—in images (and optionally in real time) using pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers.

## Overview

Haar Cascade classifiers are a machine learning based approach for object detection. In this project, we use pre-trained Haar cascade XML files provided by OpenCV to detect objects (for example, faces). Although these models are a bit dated compared to modern deep learning approaches, they are still fast and efficient for many applications.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect faces (or other objects) in images.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Option to perform detection via a webcam.
- **Customizable**: Easily switch to different Haar cascade XML files to detect various objects (e.g., eyes, smiles, full bodies).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
